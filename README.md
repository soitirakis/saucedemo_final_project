## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

Follow the steps below to execute the automated test suite locally.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Java JDK (recommended: 17+)
- Maven
- Google Chrome or Firefox

Verify installation:

```bash

java -version
mvn -version

git clone https://github.com/soitirakis/saucedemo_final_project.git
cd saucedemo_final_project

mvn clean install

mvn clean test

mvn clean test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=testng.xml

mvn clean test -Dbrowser=chrome

mvn clean test -Dbrowser=firefox

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a **CI section (GitHub Actions ready)**
- Make it more “Senior QA Engineer portfolio style”
- Or tailor it exactly to your framework (if you paste your test runner structure)

Just tell me the level you’re aiming for 🚀

## 📐 Design Principles Used

This framework follows industry best practices to ensure scalability, readability, and maintainability.

### 🧱 Page Object Model (POM)
Each page of the application is represented by a dedicated class.
This improves:
- Code reusability
- Separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance when UI changes

---

### 🔄 Reusability & DRY Principle
Common functionality (driver setup, waits, utilities, configuration handling) is abstracted into reusable components to avoid code duplication.

---

### 🧪 Test Isolation
Each test is independent and can be executed individually or as part of a suite without affecting others.

---

### 📂 Separation of Test Logic and Test Data
Test data is externalized (JSON / configuration files) to:
- Improve flexibility
- Allow easy modification without changing test logic
- Support future data-driven testing

---

### 📋 Logging & Debugging Support
Logging is implemented to provide visibility into test execution flow and simplify debugging.

---

### 🧩 Scalable Structure
The project structure supports:
- Adding new test cases easily
- Parallel execution (future improvement)
- CI/CD integration
